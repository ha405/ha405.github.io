            As a contributor to this work, I tackled the problem of representational collapse in highly sparse networks. We designed and implemented the multi-objective loss function that aligns sparse embeddings against three critical references (pretrained, fine-tuned, and historical). We tested our framework across CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Language Models to verify that our method preserves accuracy at extreme sparsity.

                Developed a framework using learnable visual queries to improve out-of-distribution performance. By training these queries with a group relative optimization objective, I guided the model to learn domain-invariant features. My implementation <strong>achieved a 3% accuracy gain</strong> on the PACS dataset over the ERM baseline. I am now extending this work by using Mechanistic Interpretability as a tool to design a methodology to physically remove domain-specific circuits from the network.

                I led a project investigating the internal failure modes of Federated Learning (FL) on Non-IID data through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability. We hypothesized that performance degradation is caused by 'circuit collapse'—the destructive interference of functional sub-networks from conflicting client updates. By training and analyzing sparse, interpretable models in an FL simulation, we provided the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data causes local circuits to diverge and collapse in the global model, reframing the statistical problem of 'weight divergence' as an observable structural failure.

                To address the varying numerical precision required at different timesteps of the diffusion process, I am developing a method for timestep-aware quantization. This involves training an MLP on the signal-to-noise ratio at a timestep to predict optimal quantization parameters based on the noise schedule. My methodology beats the vanilla timestep based MLP by 55 percent.

                Developed an augmented GPTQ framework that integrates knowledge distillation and supervised fine-tuning directly into the post-training quantization pipeline. My key technical innovation was combining the standard GPTQ Hessian with second-order curvature information from KL-divergence and cross-entropy objectives. This better preserves the teacher model's outputs, and my implementation <strong>achieved a 30% reduction in perplexity</strong> over the baseline GPTQ at equivalent bit-widths.

                Engineered a hybrid method for camera calibration combining a Transformer front-end with geometric post-processing. I took a pretrained Multi-Scale Deformable Transformer (SOFI) to predict geometric primitives like the zenith point and horizon line. From these predictions, I <strong> recovered camera's intrinsic (K) and extrinsic (R, t) parameters</strong> by enforcing mathematical constrains over the loss function, enabling recovery of the full projection matrix from a single image.

                As an MLE, I owned the optimization pipeline for an on-device object detection system. I led ONNX and TensorRT-based quantization experiments, reducing model memory footprints by approximately 40% while maintaining real-time inference. Additionally, I automated a large-scale data annotation pipeline, which improved dataset quality and resulted in a 4% accuracy uplift in validation.
