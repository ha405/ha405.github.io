            Hi, I’m Haseeb, a final-year CS undergraduate at LUMS (exp. 2026) working in domains of efficient, generalizable and interpretable ML. My research focuses on developing novel methods for <strong>model compression</strong> and <strong>domain generalization</strong>. A core theme of my work is using mechanistic interpretability to analyze how these techniques fundamentally alter a model's internal circuits, which helps deepen my understanding of the problem posed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://city.lums.edu.pk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Centre for Urban Informatics, Technology and Policy (CITY)</strong></a> at LUMS under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pd9S_mcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dr. Muhammad Tahir</a></strong> and <strong>Dr. Zubair Khalid</strong>. My projects here include the Backbone Contrastive Pruning <strong>(BaCP)</strong> framework to prevent representational collapse in extremely sparse networks. My senior project is on domain generalization where I am working to identify and remove domain specific circuits in models through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability. I have also been associated with an external company <a href="https://10xengineers.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>10x Engineers</strong></a> for Quantization of Diffusion Models where I developed a method to train MLPs on per layer timestep stats to accurately predict quantization scale and zero-point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I contributed to research at the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/CVGL-LUMS-Murtaza-Taj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Computer Vision & Graphics Lab</strong></a>, where I developed <strong>KLAWQ</strong>, a GPTQ-inspired quantization method beating, and engineered a Transformer-based system for single-image camera calibration. My experience extends to a research internship at the <strong>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</strong>, where I applied LLMs to automated software engineering challenges like debloating and code translation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond academia, my contract role as a Machine Learning Engineer at <strong>Innova Tech</strong> gave me hands-on experience in quantizing and deploying vision models on edge devices using ONNX and TensorRT. I am also an active open-source contributor to major ML libraries like timm and adapters.
